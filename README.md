# FreeOpenData.com

The mission of FreeOpenData.com is to make government agencies transparent by default by generating overwelming public demand for transparency, advocating well for black and white transparency laws, making it free and easy for governments to publish open data and over-redacted previews of records requiring manual review/redaction to a centralized public database, providing a free viable alternative to expensive open data portals, and automating as much of the public disclosure process as possible.

Bussiness plan: create the most popular open data site and offer subscription plans, consulting, adversiting, job boards, books, courses, affilate marketing, and swag.
