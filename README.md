# MegaTransparency.com

MegaTransparency.com is a soon to be launched website centralizing open data/records, news reporting and data journalism, open data powered apps, and publishers and users of mostly government information. The Founder/Chief Innovation Officer of MegaTransparency.com is Tim Clemans, whose job is to overwhelm the competition with innovation and transparency. Tim's day: code all night, go to Farestart, code, eat, sleep, and right back at making the world better through open data. Performance goal: get Kevin Merritt, CEO of Socrata (Tim lives a block away from their HQ), to send a hastily written company wide email saying "we must take right a right turn right now or a homeless dude is going to put us out of business." Email us at info@megatransparency.com Note emails will be auto published. 

## Big thanks to

King County criminal justice system, Sound Mental Health, my parents, girlfriend, and Farestart for getting me the right path. The Seattle Police Department for getting me started in automated transparency. William Stein, Founder/CEO of https://sagemath.com, for introducing me cutting edge open source technologies. Chris Metcalf, developer evangelist, for mentoring me and encouraging the company to hire me as a contractor. Bet there's going to be hell to pay for whoever's fault it was that my contract got voided right when I was supposed to start working meaning non-compete clause disappeared. Renee Teate https://twitter.com/BecomingDataSci for daily inspiration, discussion, and networking. John Sonmez https://simpleprogrammer.com/ for his blog, courses, and book. 

## Mission and Strategy

The mission of MegaTransparency.com is is to efficiently publish all the world's interesting public information in one well organized place. Aka make particularly government agencies transparent by default. The short version of the strategy is make billions of dollars each year so we can offer governments the sweet deal of taking over transparency efforts for free. The long version of the strategy is to create overwhelming public demand for transparency, advocate well for forceful black and white transparency laws, make the disclosure of information as efficient as possible, use public disclosure laws to their fullest reasonable potential, and make it extremely easy to make positive use of open data. A key strategy for making governments transparent by default is to get to the point where MegaTransparency can completely take over transparency work at no cost to each agency. The information would be made available to the public completely free. In order to do this, MegaTransparency needs about sixty million dollars a year just for Washington State. So the business plan is to create the most popular open data site and generate money through subscription plans, consulting, advertising, job boards, book and course publishing, affiliate marketing, and swag.

We will generate overwhelming public demand for transparency by putting on lots of public presentations about transparency, being on the news every month advocating that the public demand transparency. We will track the uses of transparency.

Most of today's transparency laws are transparency to a given requester. We want to change that to automated publishing to a centralized international database of all non-exempt records not requiring manual review or redaction and automated publishing of over-redacted previews of non-exempt records that would require manual review or redaction. We want to make manual public disclosure highly efficient by getting transparency laws to mandate that:
1. Records be created in electronic form in machine readable format
1. Signatures be added electronically
1. All records management software as implemented support automated retrieval of records
1. Exemptions are black and white eliminating guessing about whether or not a piece of information needs to be redacted, third party notification inviting lawsuit when agencies should just be releasing or not releasing records, and long court reviews of good faith decisions
1. Public safety records not requiring manual redaction are automatically sent to involved parties including attorneys
1. Employees are trained in exemptions and when creating records mark what information needs to be redacted, except for public safety audio and video that isn't tied to a police report, and that agencies are to depend on those markings
1. Schemas of databases are to be published
1. Raw data powering cloud services used by the government be subject to disclosure. For example Taser's evidence.com has an audit trail system. The entire listing of what happened to each piece of evidence should be public just like that for Seattle Police's COBAN dashcam system: https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/COBAN-Logs/tpvk-5fr3/data
1. Companies publish diversity stats

To make the disclosure of information as efficient as possible MT will provide a free open source hosted viable alternative to expensive open data and records requesting portals.

In the beginning MT is going to have to request most data through the various public records acts. 

Make the use of open data so easy that people pay good money to use the same tools on private data.

## History

The site was created in response to http://datasmart.ash.harvard.edu/news/article/an-open-letter-to-the-open-data-community-988 and an erroneous Google marketing blurb claiming public datasets are hosted for free on BigQuery. Orginally the site was going to be called FreeOpenData.com but Tim locked himself out of the domains account by canceling his phone account before disabling two-factor auth. MegaTransparency.com is owned by WayEasy Corporation, which is lead by Tim Clemans https://transparenttim.com. Tim had the honor of working for Seattle Police as an employee piloting automatic publishing of over-redacted body camera videos and police report narratives to give frequent records requesters a tool for making narrow records requests, see https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/magazine/police-body-cameras.html?_r=0 Tim is currently homeless, housed in a private room in a shelter, while he finishes life skills and food service training at http://farestart.org Starting in about two months, he needs to make about a thousand a month to make ends meet. Becoming a contractor for Socrata to improve on what he did at Seattle Police fell through and his last employer SageMath Inc https://sagemathcloud.com decided it was too stressful to review the code he wrote. So now he's focusing on employing himself to make governments transparent by default. Funding for the site currently comes from Tim's parents. 

## Values

* Transparent by default: 
  * Clear business rules
  * Staff mark what information is exempt
  * Non-exempt information is auto published
  * All code is open source under Apache License unless using an existing code base that is licensed as GPL/AGPL (Wordpress/CKAN/CoCalc)

## Competitors

Competitive strategy: overhelm the competition with innovation and transparency

Top competitors: https://muckrock.com, https://www.kaggle.com/, https://data.world, https://socrata.com, https://carto.com/, https://opengov.com/, http://govqa.com/, and https://www.nextrequest.com/.

Initially we're focused on competeting with MuckRock and DataWorld because these sites focus on making money from end users like us. It'll take time to build the government relationships needed to compete with Socrata, OpenGov, Carto, GovQA, and NextRequest. It's important that Socrata in particular see megatransparency as encouraging more agencies to adopt open data and look into Socrata. Maybe they can be advertisers at some point if user is using a known government computer. One strategy to consider with say Socrata is to say "We want transparency to be free and as automated as possible. What do you think of focusing on becoming the analytics platform governments rely on and make transparency an automatic byproduct of that?"

## Roadmap and Status

### Roadmap

* Don't start filing public disclosure requests until have the money to pay for them and don't file one requiring legal action until have money for lawyers

#### Income goals

1. \$2,000/month: 100 \$19.99 subscribers (yes I know that 19.99 * 100 is just under 2K and that there will be credit card processing fees)
   * $12,000/year in total compensation for Tim Clemans including social security taxes and benefits
   * $12,000/year for computer related costs, records request fees, and other expenses/taxes and saving up
